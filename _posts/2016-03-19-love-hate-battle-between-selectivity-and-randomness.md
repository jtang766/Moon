THE LOVE-HATE BATTLE BETWEEN SELECTIVITY AND RANDOMNESS.
3/19/2016 0 Comments
 
When making this these paper flowers for an upcoming event, I found myself combining different shapes of petals with different designs of anthers due to my susceptibility to repeated creations. Of course, not all designs will work with each other, which got me thinking of the selectivity of nature and the many years of evolution invested in giving the world the best of the best species.

I believe that since the beginning of the existence of human species we have been fighting nature, exponentially more in the industrial revolution. In Michael Pollen’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma, he talks about the conflict between mankind and nature and our desire to change the natural process in the cycle of life. Coming from a highly analytical background, I have noticed we have a tendency to over-generalize and simplify.

In my studies, there were times where the end goal was to find the few variables that produce the greatest influence and highest significance. As we have discovered, many relations are not just dependent on a few variables. At times, variables may interact with each other and correlations are almost never one to one. Nature is built from evolving randomness and selection of the best - kind of like a business model plan that is ever changing and improving. When performing analysis, it is good to note nature’s complexity and understand that the solution might just arise from randomness.

SPICE RACK, THE TABLE OF ELEMENTS TO MY EVERYDAY DINNER EXPERIMENTS. 
3/10/2016 0 Comments
 
I am sure by now, most if not all of you who have Netflix have watched the documentary series ‘Cooked’ by Michael Pollen. For those that have not, the series takes viewers on a journey through the history of cooking, with a view of how cultures cultivate the elements of fire, water, air and earth into their cooking traditions.

Not sure what came first for me the love of chemistry or the love of cooking, but cooking is where I find common ground with my peers. Like all hobbies, we need tools in order to explore the realm of our interest. The tools you can find in the kitchen can range from cooking appliances, cooking utensils, oils, pots and pans, and of course spices. Spices, I think, represent an introductory kit for amateur cooks, an easy way to get started with making your own meals and transforming them into something enjoyable and different every day.

I take much pride in my spice collection because I see it as the table of elementary addition and the best use of counter space. I have collected about 30 spices and the number keeps growing.

CHALLENGE YOUR CREATIVE SIDE WITH EVERYDAY PROJECTS.
12/6/2015 0 Comments
 
In the same way a bird will build its nest, humans like to decorate their homes and devote more time to the building of their home after signing a mortgage paper. Industrial design and interior design is an art that is often underappreciated. I am not talking about the art which is priced in the thousands; I am talking about the everyday creative thinking and problem solving which normal citizens will experience when designing their home and expressing their personalities. A step into someone’s home is a bigger step into their life.

What information do you gather from simple things like a coaster the hostess is using? Does your environment represent your goals and aspirations?

Protecting the environment is very important to me and every day I challenge myself and the people around me to have zero environmental impact, mainly in terms of reducing waste. Today, while painting, the longevity of this artwork really bothered me. Given that I moved 3 times is the last 2 years, I wanted to ensure that this piece was made to last. This challenge in the usability of this painting resulted in a design that will not only fit a wall of a rectangular structure but a wall of an irregular parallelogram.

PRACTICE EMPATHY AND DISCOVER CLARITY.

The practice of empathy is the practice of shifting your attention to someone else. This noncenteric exercise has many rewarding benefits including gaining insights, therapeutic relief from your life, improvements to your listening skills and enhancing your curiosity and the list can go on. One of the best methods of practicing empathy is reading a book. Fiction or non-fiction, the level of detail in the characters’ thoughts, emotions and surroundings offer you an opportunity to explore your own ability to empathize with others and is the best way of experiencing life through their point of view.
 
I believe that the quarter-life crisis is a result of a lack of empathy. Most of us graduate from undergrad to enter a race towards achievements and then get lost in living someone else’s life plan. I suggest reading a biography as a way to test out the waters of someone else’s life. I did not know much about Chris’s life before I read this book, but I figured that the life of an astronaut could definitely offer some insights on my role in this world. This book taught me the simple logic of being human and put the aspects of my career, my social responsibility, my environmental impact and the impact of fame into alignment with each other. If you had questioned yourself by asking “what am I going to do with my life” in the last 3 days, I suggest heading out on this 284-page journey.
