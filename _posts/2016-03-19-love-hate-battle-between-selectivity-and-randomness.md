When making this these paper flowers for an upcoming event, I found myself combining different shapes of petals with different designs of anthers due to my susceptibility to repeated creations. Of course, not all designs will work with each other, which got me thinking of the selectivity of nature and the many years of evolution invested in giving the world the best of the best species.

I believe that since the beginning of the existence of human species we have been fighting nature, exponentially more in the industrial revolution. In Michael Pollen’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma, he talks about the conflict between mankind and nature and our desire to change the natural process in the cycle of life. Coming from a highly analytical background, I have noticed we have a tendency to over-generalize and simplify.

In my studies, there were times where the end goal was to find the few variables that produce the greatest influence and highest significance. As we have discovered, many relations are not just dependent on a few variables. At times, variables may interact with each other and correlations are almost never one to one. Nature is built from evolving randomness and selection of the best - kind of like a business model plan that is ever changing and improving. When performing analysis, it is good to note nature’s complexity and understand that the solution might just arise from randomness.
