## STATISTICAL COLLABORATION PROGRAM AND PROFESSOR ALISON GIBBS

I was given the opportunity to work as statistician with real life data and gained experience in collaborating with researchers of different fields. Within a team of 3 statisticians we worked with the client from the Department of Ecology and developed a statistical model that transformed video images of the behavior of laboratory mutant worms into quantitative data. Through further analysis we were able to determine which genes relate to a change in the subconscious behavior and which genes created a physical disability.
