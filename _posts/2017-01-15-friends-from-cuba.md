## Like the thousands of tourist that goes to visits Cuba, 

we stayed in an all exclusive resort in Varadero. The initial plan was use the resort as a shelter, for food, and our morning coffee. However, there was more for us to learn from within our small resort then we ever imagined. Don’t get me wrong, during the last two days of our semi-productive agenda, we ventured out of Varadero to one of the fresh water caves, and learned as much as we can about the culture and governance of Cuba during our day trip to Havana. 









However, when we left our resort we left a piece of our heart with our flurry friends. 
Whenever I find new flurry creature, I give it name (not necessarily the most original or creative) but to build a friendship. Later on, this tradition prove to be more useful since in total we made more than 10 little friends. 

Each one these resort animal had their own personality that can be easily mistaken as a beg for food if you don’t take a time to known them. Trust me they have more than enough to eat, they live in a resort. An exception was Cookie dough, begging for food was his talent. Marmalade was god mother that took care of four little kittens living under the kid’s playground around (Diamond, Chip, Midnight and Boots). After seeing her watched over us feeding the kittens food and we quickly gain each other’s trust. Midnight among his siblings was the mot weak and may have been slightly sick. Lo-fu was the elderly that lived within the building and have establish his reputation. If I were to continue talking about this cute little creature, I will come off as more of crazy cat lady than it may already seem. I surely learned a lot about Cuba but the friends I made which I may never see again are the ones I will never forget.
