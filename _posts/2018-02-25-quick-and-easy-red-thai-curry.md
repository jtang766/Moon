## The way I see cooking is that every dish has its base, 

an elementary food that we love so much that we want to test the limit of enjoyment by adding in our personal flavor. Whether it's pasta (tomatoes, olive oil), Alfredo (cream), or Thai curry (coconut Milk), they all have a base. This recipe is my version of Thai Red Thai Curry. This usually that takes about 30mins but recently I have been experimenting with my slow cooker. This machine has gifted me the pleasure of soft meat. Yeah you heard what I said. Though initially, I didn't understand the benefit of setting your food in the morning and having it ready by the time you come home because I just couldn't wake up early enough, but I have found my work around. The value in the recipe is in the efficiency, so no to reason not to experiment on your own with the extra time you save. If you are using a different slow cooker, you would want to check-out the Tips and Hints of the manual to see how you can improve on the method, and please share to the community below.


Prep Time: 25 mins 				Cook Time: 4-6 hrs (Slow-cooker)	

Slow cooker: Cuisinart - 3.5 Quart Programmable Slow Cooker


## INGREDIENTS

-	2kg of chicken or beef
-	One onion 
-	One red pepper
-	2cm of ginger or 1 tsp ginger paste (one tea spoon)
-	4 Thai chilli peppers
-	1 tbsp of Coconut oil
-	1 can of coconut milk 

Choose one of these:
-	i tbsp of Red Thai curry paste
-	1 tsbp of Coconut Thai curry powder
-	2 tsp of Turmeric powder (If only use this, then you have Thai yellow curry) 

You don't need all these spices so pick and choose, at least 4. I always use dried flakes since they last long in the shelves, but you are more than welcome to use fresh ingredients.  
-	½ tsp Parsley flakes
-	1 tsp Basil flakes
-	½ tsp Curry powder
-	½ tsp Garlic powder
-	½ tspCoriander flakes 

## INSTRUCTIONS
1.	First brown the meat you are using. This hardens the edge, so the meat doesn't fall apart. 
2.	Cut your onion into slices. You can throw in the onions and stir fly with the meat. 
3.	While you cook your meat, cut your veggies and prep the slow cooker - slice the red peppers, cut the stems off the Thai chilli paper and squash the pepper flat (slice it down if you can handle the heat); and dice your potatoes. 
4.	Once you are done browning the meat, add it to your collection. Combine all your spices, ginger paste and coconut oil. 
5.	Store in the fridge
6.	In the morning, move the pot into slow cooker. Add in your coconut milk. 
7.	Wait 15 mins while it heats up. Good time to get ready for work. Then stir and mix all the spices. 
8.	Set on high for 6 hrs for beef and 4 hours for chicken -OR- set on low for 8 hrs for beef and 6 hours for chicken
9.	Enjoy with rice or rice noodles.
