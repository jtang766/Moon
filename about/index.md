## Growing up 

in the information era, I live by believing that there is no limit to the accumulation of knowledge. I have let my curiosity guide me through the completion of my degree in analytical chemistry and statistics. Analytical Chemistry because I questioned the ways of nature and the behaviors of matter right down to the molecular level, and for everything else there was statistics to quantify and answer questions of correlations.

I often find myself interchanging between my two disciplines to produce quality research by providing confidence with statistical analysis and an understanding of causation with scientific theory. Aside from the methodology and accuracy in predictions, I strongly believe in the importance of communication and education of relevant research findings.

##Currently 

I am a digital analyst working with major brands and media agencies in understanding behaviors within the digital landscape. I believe this is not as simple correlations but a series influences and social changes that drives changes in user behavior and online marketing. We are yet close to equilibrium, which creates a challenge in the predictability of our models. 
When we better understand the thought process of individuals we can better serve society so that everyone has the ability to lead a healthy, socially responsible, happy and environmentally conscious lifestyle. That is my goal in life, to be an educator - a communicator of how the rest of us lives in this world.  

##I am constantly learning 

and bringing the knowledge that I gain to the people around me. I love to meet new people and exchange stories. Besides having my head in loads of data, I occasional practice creativity by creating art and making dresses. This is how I express my personality and bring character to the subtle parts of our lives.
