## Growing up 

in the information era, I live by believing that there is no end to the accumulation of knowledge. I have let my curiosity guide me through the completion of my degree in Analytical Chemistry and Statistics. Analytical Chemistry because I questioned the ways of nature and the behaviours of matter right down to the molecular level, and for everything else there was statistics to quantify and answer questions of correlations.

I often find myself interchanging between the two disciplines to produce quality research by providing confidence with statistical analysis and an understanding of causation with scientific theory. Aside from the methodology and accuracy in predictions, I strongly believe in the importance of communication and education of relevant research findings.

During my senior years at my alma mater, I was given the opportunity to experimentally design and manage research projects with researchers from many disciplines, including Public Health, Environment and Evolution & Ecology. The most rewarding part of every experience was the final presentation, where I spoke on the observed trends and explained the new approach we used.

## Currently, 

I am a digital analyst working with major brands and media agencies to understand behaviours within the digital landscape. I believe there are not simple correlations, but rather a series of influences and social changes that drive changes in user behaviour and online marketing. Changes have yet to reach equilibrium, which creates a challenge in the accuracy of our models but makes every day interesting. 

When we better understand the thought process of individuals, we can better serve society. That is my goal in life, to be an educator - a communicator of how the rest of us lives in this world.
