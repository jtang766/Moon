When making this these paper flowers for an upcoming event, I found myself combining different shapes of petals with different designs of anthers so I would not have any repeating flower designs. Of course, not all designs will work with each other, which got me thinking of the selectivity of nature and the many years of evolution invested in giving the world the best of the best species.

At times, it might feel like humanity has been at war with nature, especially more after the industrial revolution. In Michael Pollen’s book The Omnivore’s Dilemma, he talks about the conflict between mankind and nature and our desire to change the natural process. Coming from a highly analytical background, I have noticed we have a tendency to over-generalize and simplify a complex system.

In many of my studies, the end goal was to find the few good variables withe the greatest influence and highest significance. As we have discovered, many relations are not just dependent on a few variables. At times, variables may interact with each other and correlations are almost never one to one. Nature is built from evolving randomness and selection of the top few - kind of like an aglie business model that is ever changing and improving. When problem solving, it is good to consider that the nature of the problem is complex and the answer might not be so simple. note nature’s complexity and understand that the solution might just arise from randomness.
